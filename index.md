### General Information

*This workshop aims to train young scientists in implementing the FAIR principles for research data & software management & development.* We want to help you identify similarities and differences between these two scientific objects and apply respectively appropriate good practices in preparing, publishing and archiving your work.
We will focus on one topic / principle per day, introducing its reasoning, benefits, and (differing and/or shared) implications for *proper research data/software management/development* together with the learners. We'll follow-up the theory-leaning introductions in the mornings with discussions and
live-coding sessions, using (Software & Data) Carpentry materials to illustrate and practice a principle's implementation in the [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) disciplines ("[MINT-Fächer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINT-F%C3%A4cher)").
Regardless of discipline, learners are encouraged to bring questions about their own data and source code, we can answer those during the week. 

<p align="center">
<em>
  It is a new, experimental workshop format that contextualises the highly practical lesson material from the <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software</a> and <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data</a> <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries</a> with the <a href="https://blogs.tib.eu/wp/tib/2017/09/12/the-fair-data-principles-for-research-data/">FAIR principles</a>
</em>
</p>


### Who?

Young scientists who wish to excel at
implementing the FAIR principles for research data and scientific
software. **You need to have some previous knowledge of the tools
that will be presented at the workshop.**


### When & Where?

Please see [events.tib.eu/fair-data-software
](https://events.tib.eu/fair-data-software/)
for all the details, including public transport directions and
[accommodation suggestions](https://events.tib.eu/fair-data-software/accommodation/). You can also find us on [OpenStreetMap
](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat={{page.latlng | replace:',','&mlon='}}&zoom=16)
and [add the event to your Google
Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=FAIR Data and Software&dates={{ page.startdate | replace: "-", "" }}/{{ page.enddate | replace: "-", "" | plus: 0}}&trp=false&sprop&sprop=name:&sf=true&output=xml&location={{ page.address }}&details=Carpentries-based workshop at the {{ page.venue }}").


### Costs

Thanks to a [grant by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)](https://www.bildung-forschung.digital/de/ideenwettbewerb-zum-digitalen-wandel-in-der-wissenschaft-2007.html) there are **none** directly for attending the workshop. However, participants need to organise and pay for travel and [accommodation](#when--where) themselves.


### Food

We provide **fruits, biscuits, tea, coffee, mineral water**, as well as both a **vegan and a non-vegan lunch** meal on each of the five days free of charge. Participants will need to obtain breakfasts and dinners outside of TIB. Many cuisine options from bakeries and to restaurants are located within walking distance.


### Requirements

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed [below](#setup)). They are also required to abide by the Carpentries' [Code of Conduct]({{site}}/conduct.html).

**Please note: This workshop focuses on the application** of the FAIR Principles on scientific data and software. Because it covers a variety of examples, it does require a basic knowledge of the tools listed in [the schedule](#schedule). If you are interested in learning these basics, please consider applying for one of the (non-experimental) [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) and [Data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-upcoming/) Carpentry workshops, or [work through](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) their [material](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) in a self-paced manner.


### Accessibility

We try to make this workshop as accessible to everybody as
possible. If we can help you in any way, please
[get in touch](#contact) and we will attempt to provide.
We will prepare the venue to be **wheelchair-accessible** upon request.


### Recordings

We will record some or all of the lectures during this workshop and publish
them on the [TIB AV-Portal](https://av.tib.eu/). Discussion
sessions will not be recorded. 


### Contact

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email us: [{{page.email}}](mailto:{{page.email}}).

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
    for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.

        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on macOS and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.6 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>,
      a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all
      <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).

  <h3>R</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use
    <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.

        Install R by downloading and running

        <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio IDE</a>.
        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later,
        for example when installing R packages.

  <h3>OpenRefine</h3>
  <p>
    For this lesson you will need <em>OpenRefine</em> and a
    web browser. <em>Note:</em> this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud).
    It runs inside a web browser, but no web connection is needed.

      <p>
        Check that you have either the Firefox or the Chrome browser installed and set as your default browser.
        <strong>OpenRefine runs in your default browser.</strong>
        It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>Download software from <a href="http://openrefine.org/">http://openrefine.org/</a></p>
      <p>Create a new directory called OpenRefine.</p>
      <p>Unzip the downloaded file into the OpenRefine directory by right-clicking and selecting "Extract ...". </p>
      <p>Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.</p>
      <p>Launch OpenRefine by clicking <code>google-refine.exe</code> (this will launch a command prompt window, but you can ignore that - just wait for OpenRefine to open in the browser).</p>
      <p>If you are using a different browser, or if OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3333/">http://127.0.0.1:3333/</a> or <a href="http://localhost:3333">http://localhost:3333</a> to use the program.</p>

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
